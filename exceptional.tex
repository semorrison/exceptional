\begin{abstract}
  We find a single two-parameter skein relation on trivalent graphs,
  the \emph{quantum exceptional relation}, that specializes to a skein
  relation associated to each exceptional Lie algebra (in the adjoint
  representation). If a slight
  strengthening of Deligne's conjecture on the existence of a
  (classical) exceptional series is true, then this relation
  holds for a new two-variable quantum exceptional polynomial, at
  least as a power series near $q=1$. The
  single quantum exceptional relation implies both the
  Jacobi relation (true for every Lie algebra) and
  the Vogel relation holding for the exceptional series.

  We find a conjectural basis for the space of diagrams with $n$ loose
  ends modulo the quantum exceptional relation for $n \le 7$, with
  dimensions agreeing with the classical computations, and compute
  the matrix of inner products. (Dimensions of idempotents?)
  We use the
  skein relation to compute the conjectural quantum exceptional
  polynomial for many knots, in particular
  determining unconditionally the values of the quantum polynomials
  for the exceptional Lie algebras in the adjoint representation on
  these knots.

\section{The quantum exceptional relation}
\label{sec:relation}

\begin{theorem}
  Suppose that $Q$ is a skein theory on framed trivalent graphs so that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a circle has a scalar value;
  \item a self-loop takes has value $0$;
  \item changing the framing by~$1$ multiplies by a scalar $v^{12}$;
  \item crossing two strands near a vertex multiplies by a scalar; and
  \item the six diagrams (\dots) satisfy a linear relation.
  \end{itemize}
  (For instance, we may assume that the dimension of the space of
  $n$-boxes for $n=0,\dots,4$ is $1$, $0$, $1$, $1$, and $\le 5$.)
  Then, if $v^{12} \ne 1$, either $Q$ vanishes on all trivalent graphs
  or it satisfies the quantum exceptional relation.
\end{theorem}

\section{Scratch}
Here are some things Scott is hoping to work on soon:
\begin{itemize}
\item write a link evaluator using the clasp switch relation (in progress)
\item compute the action of the 3-strand braid group on diagrams with 4
boundary points
\begin{itemize}
\item find the eigenvalues of the generators and the scalar by which the full twist
acts; compare against Tuba-Wenzl \cite{MR1815266}.
\end{itemize}
\item try to compute the 3-strand braid group action on a basis for the 3-boxes
\begin{itemize}
\item perhaps even try to compute the structure coefficients for a basis for
the 3-boxes?
\end{itemize}
\item find the value of dodecahedron
\begin{itemize}
\item by computing the determinant of inner
products of 80 elements, including the difference of the two threepents, to
obtain a linear identity in the polyhedron
\item but linear algebra in
rational functions in 2 variables is very slow
\item perhaps finding the value at particular points and interpolating is worth
a try?
\item perhaps linear algebra with rational functions in \emph{one} variable,
then interpolating for the second, is also worth a try!
\end{itemize}
\item write a human readable summary of the computer calculation that braided +
$1,0,1,1,5,\leq16$ implies a planar pentasquare reduction formula
\item derive the planar pentasquare reduction formula directly from quantum IHX
\begin{quote}
``From your formula to get a planar pentasquare reduction, first note the second term can be rewritten using Jacobi as a difference of two planar diagrams.  Then we need to look at the third term, which is harder (there has to be one hard term because we haven't used Vogel's relation yet).  Use Vogel's relation to replace the square with a crossing and planar stuff.  This gives five terms,  three of which are easily rewritten to be planar.  Of the remaining two, one of them you can pull a Y through a crossing and then use Vogel to rewrite the crossing as planar stuff, and the other you can use Vogel directly on the crossing to get planar terms including a pentasquare.''
---Noah
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}
Feel free to advise or criticize these plans!
