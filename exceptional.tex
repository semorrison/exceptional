\begin{abstract}
  We find a single two-parameter skein relation on trivalent graphs,
  the \emph{quantum exceptional relation}, that specializes to a skein
  relation associated to each exceptional Lie algebra (in the adjoint
  representation). If a slight
  strengthening of Deligne's conjecture on the existence of a
  (classical) exceptional series is true, then this relation
  holds for a new two-variable quantum exceptional polynomial, at
  least as a power series near $q=1$. The
  single quantum exceptional relation implies both the
  Jacobi relation (true for every Lie algebra) and
  the Vogel relation holding for the exceptional series.

  We find a conjectural basis for the space of diagrams with $n$ loose
  ends modulo the quantum exceptional relation for $n \le 7$, with
  dimensions agreeing with the classical computations, and compute
  the matrix of inner products. (Dimensions of idempotents?)
  We use the
  skein relation to compute the conjectural quantum exceptional
  polynomial for many knots, in particular
  determining (unconditionally) the values of the quantum polynomials
  for the exceptional Lie algebras on
  these knots. The knots we can compute for include all knots with up
  to 11 (12?) crossings.

A proposed new outline:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two-variable knot polynomials. For a two-variable knot polynomial to
exist, we first need a family of Lie algebras, and second need a coherent
quantisation of the family. We propose that this can be achieved in the 
exceptional series, and give many calculations of the conjectured knot
invariant.
\item Deligne's classical exceptional series, generators, relations, and 
conjectures.
\item The main result of this paper is a conjecture.
The quantum exceptional series, generators and relations and conjectures.
\item The rest of the paper consists of two kinds of evidence for this 
conjecture.
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, we show that the proposed description of the quantum exceptional 
series is the right one --- it is picked out as the unique braided tangle
category
with ...
\item Second, we give some weak evidence that the conjecture is viable.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We propose bases for the $n$-box spaces, $n \leq 6$ (or is it 7?), 
showing that these are linear independent, and their spans are closed under
various operations.
\item We show that these give representations of the affine $n$-strand braid 
groups, for $n \leq 6$.
\item We calculate ridiculously many two-variable knot polynomials; although 
these are conjectural, they unconditionally specialise to the correct quantum
knot polynomials for the exceptional Lie algebras.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

There are two main 2-variable knot polynomials: the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and the Kauffman polynomial.  The HOMFLY-PT polynomial interpolates between the Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants of the standard representation of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, while the Kauffman polynomial does the same for the standard representations of quantum $U_q(\mathfrak{o}_n)$ (or, in a slightly different form, the standard representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sp}_n)$).  The two variable nature of these knot polynomials come from the two parameters $n$ and $q$.  One can think of this process in two steps: first show that there's a family of Lie algebra objects in symmetric tensor categories which interpolate between the $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ yielding something called $\mathfrak{gl}_t$, and second quantizing these Lie algebra objects.   This quantization can be done systematically using the Kontsevich integral, provided it converges.  Conjecturally, based on work of Deligne, Vogel, and others, there is a third $1$-parameter family of Lie algebra objects in symmetric tensor categories called the exceptional series which interpolates between $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, $\mathfrak{sl}_3$, $\mathfrak{so}_8$, $\mathfrak{g}_2$, $\mathfrak{f}_4$, $\mathfrak{e}_6$, $\mathfrak{e}_7$, and $\mathfrak{e}_8$.  If the classical exceptional family exists, we should again expect a quantization yielding a 2-variable exceptional knot polynomial.  In this paper we give a conjectural skein theoretic description of this exceptional knot polynomial, furthermore we prove that these skein relations must hold for the exceptional knot polynomial if it exists, and we use these skein relations to do many computations.  In particular, we are able to calculate the value of this knot polynomial (if it exists) on all knots of Conway girth 6, which includes all knots of 12 or fewer crossings.  For example, we compute the following value for the trefoil.

\subsection{Linear independence, and closure under operations}

\subsection{Matrices}
Recall that we have candidate bases for 
$\V_n = \operatorname{Hom}(1 \to V^{\otimes n})$, for $n$ at most 6.
In this section, we obtain matrices for the braiding and rotation operators on
 $\V_n$.

We have a pairing $\langle - , - \rangle: \V_n \otimes \V_n \to \V_0$ defined
by 
\[
  \langle x, y \rangle =
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline]
    \node[draw, shape=semicircle, shape border rotate=180, minimum size=1.5em] (x) {$x$};
    \node[draw, shape=semicircle, shape border rotate=180, minimum size=1.5em, right=0.5cm of x] (y) {$y$};
    \draw (x.90) to[in=90, out=90] (y.90);
    \draw (x.135) to[in=90, out=90] (y.45);
    \draw (x.45) to[in=90, out=90] (y.135);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
and for many (conjecturally all) diagrams in $\V_0$ we can use the relations
to evaluate to a rational function in \(\QQ(v,w)\). Of course, our basis is
far from orthonormal with respect to this pairing!
We find that up to $n=6$, we can evaluate all matrix entries of
$M_n = \left(\langle e_i, e_j \rangle\right)_{i,j}$,
but rather unfortunately inverting this matrix is computationally infeasible
for $n=6$. (Recall that arithmetic over $\QQ(v,w)$ may be quite inefficient!)

Now, given an operator $T: \V_n \to \V_m$, the associated matrix with respect 
to our chosen basis is $AM_m^{-1}$, where
$A = \left(\langle T e_i, e_j \rangle\right)_{i,j}$. 
We find that for $T$ any of

for values of $n$ so that source and target are amongst $\V_0, \ldots, \V_6$,
we can evaluate all of the matrix entries of $A$ as rational functions.
(Even though $H_n = \rho_{n}^{-1} \fuse_n \rho_{n+1} \fork_n$, this does not
allow us to compute the matrix for $H_6$, so we need to find this directly.)

Even though directly inverting $M$ is infeasible, we find that we can
calculate the product $A M^{-1}$ in each case. (Nevertheless this remains a
difficult calculation. \nn{some explanation of what we do, with the CRT})

Explicit matrices are available with the {\tt arXiv} sources of this article, 
as the files {\tt /matrices/OP-n.m}, where {\tt OP} is one of {\tt rotation},

\subsection{Representations of braid groups}

\subsection{A 2-variable link polynomial}

\subsubsection{Limited planar operations}
Thinking of the vector spaces $\V_n$ as forming a planar algebra, 
at this point we have limited access to the full set of operations indexed by
planar tangles. We have computed above
$\cap_n : \V_n \to \V_{n-2}$, 
$\cup_n : \V_n \to V_{n+2}$, and
$\rho_n: \V_n \to \V_n$. We can also find
\begin{align*}
(m_{4,4,2} : \V_4 \otimes \V_4 \to \V_4) & = ... \\
(m_{4,6,2} : \V_4 \otimes \V_6 \to \V_6) & = ... \\
\intertext{and}
(m_{4,4,1} : \V_4 \otimes \V_4 \to \V_6) & = ... 
\end{align*}
 as follows.

Recall that our chosen basis for $\V_4$ is
\[
  \left(
    ...
  \right)
\]
Expressed in our chosen bases, we then have 
\begin{align*}
  m_{4,n,2}((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) \otimes y)
    & = x_1 \cup_{n-2}\cap_n y \\
      & \quad + x_2 y \\
      & \quad + x_3 \fork_{n-1}\fuse_n y \\
      & \quad + x_4 H_n y \\
      & \quad + x_5 \beta y.
\end{align*}
Finally, we can write $m_{4,4,1}$ in terms of the other operations, as \nn{...}

\subsubsection{Conway girth}
Typically, we may choose to think about a diagrammatically defined tangle 
invariant as a morphism of planar algebras 
$\operatorname{Tangle} \to \mathcal{Q}$ for some planar algebra
$\mathcal{Q}$, sending the crossing to a suitable element of $\mathcal{Q}_4$.
In our case we only know a limited set of operations in the target planar
algebra, and so can only compute the invariants of links which we can generate
from the crossing using those available planar operations.

\begin{definition}
The \emph{width} of a planar graph generically embedded in the plane is the 
maximum number of intersections with a horizontal line. The width of a planar
graph is the minimum width over all generic embeddings.

The \emph{Conway width} of a 4-valent planar graph is the width of the graph 
after repeatedly collapsing all digons. The Conway width of a link is the
Conway width of its shadow.
\end{definition}

It is easy to see that with the available planar operations, we can evaluate 
all Conway width 6 links.

\begin{lemma}
All knots and links with at most 12 crossings with two exceptions \nn{...}
have Conway width at most 6.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The Conway width of a link is the width of the Conway basic polyhedron 
obtained after collapsing all digons. One can enumerate the basic polyhedron
with $n$ vertices using Brinkmann and McKay's {\tt plantri} program
\cite{MR2357364,MR2186681}, with the command {\tt plantri -qda -c2 <n+2>}. 
All basic polyhedra with less than 12 vertices have width at most 6, and of 
the 12 vertex basic polyhedra all but 12C (the cuboctahedron) and 12G (using 
the naming scheme from \cite{MR679310}) have width at most 6. These graphs,
made into alternating links, are the two exceptions described above.
\end{proof}
In fact, almost all prime knots up to 11 crossings have bridge number 
at most 3, and hence width at most 6, with 15 exceptions, all Montesinos
knots. Montesinos knots are easily seen to have Conway width 4.%
\footnote{The exceptions are 11a43, 11a44, 11a47, 11a57, 11a231,
  11a263, 11n71, 11n72, 11n73, 11n74, 11n75, 11n76, 11n77, 11n78, and
  11n81. \cite{1208.4233}}
Interestingly all knots with at most 14 crossings have Conway width at most 6.
If we were able to work with Conway width 8, we could nearly exhaust the 
available tables of knots and links; every Conway basic polyhedron with at 
most 19 vertices has width at most 8.

The obvious greedy algorithm (repeatedly collapse digons, when that is not 
possible apply $m_{4,4,1}$ to merge two 4-boxes into a 6-box, and afterwards
hope that $m_{6,4,2}$  suffices to combine all remaining 4-boxes into that
6-box) works on all but one prime knot up to 12 crossings, except \nn{... is
it worth explaining this? perhaps it illustrates the greedy algorithm}

\subsubsection{Examples}
Using the above observations, we have computed the (conjectural!) 
invariant $\xi$ of all prime links up to 11 crossings, and all prime knots up
to 12 crossings. We observe that the values of $\xi$ are always of the form
$$\xi(L) - d^{k} = 
\frac{[3][4][\lambda-6][\lambda+5]}{[1][2][\lambda-1]^{k+1} [\lambda]^{k+1}} \mathcal E(L),$$
where $d = \xi(\textrm{unknot}) = ...$, $k$ is the number of components of $L$, 
and $\mathcal E(L)$ is some Laurent polynomial (not just a rational function)
in $v$ and $w$. These polynomials $\mathcal E (L)$ are tabulated
\nn{ at ...}, and in machine readable format as \nn{...} in the {\tt arXiv} sources.

It would be desirable to verify that these computed invariants specialize 
correctly to the quantum link invariants of the adjoint representations of the
exceptional Lie algebras. Unfortunately, these invariants have previously been
rather hard to compute, so there is little available to check against. The Lie
algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ lies on the exceptional curve, and so the 2nd
coloured Jones polynomial  (that is, colored by the 3-dimensional adjoint
representation) should be the \nn{$w = ...,  v= ...$} specialisation. This is
indeed the case for all the links tabulated above.

Even for the adjoint representation of $G_2$, an earlier program by the first
author for computing quantum knot invariants gets only as far as the trefoil. 
Sure enough, we have
$$\xi(3_1) = ...$$
which at \nn{$w = ...,  v= ...$} gives \nn{...}

\nn{check using the adjoint representation skein theory provided by Greg; many errors in his formulas!}

The fact that $\xi(12^n_{...}) = ...$ suggests that the $E_8$ adjoint quantum 
knot invariant should be $$...$$, but previous methods haven't come close to
computing this.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this paper, we study a conjectural \emph{quantum exceptional
  series}. To give a first statement of the conjecture, consider the
field of rational functions in two variables $v$ and~$w$, and define
\begin{align*}
[k\lambda + n] &= w^kv^n - w^{-k}v^{-n}\\
\{k\lambda + n\} &= w^k v^n + w^{-k} v^{-n} = \frac{[2k+2n]}{[k+n]}.
\end{align*}
This is analogous to ``quantum integer'' notation, adapted to a
two-variable setting, but note that there is no denominator.
\DPTtodo{Will need names for field of rational functions, as well as
  rings with various denominators}

Now consider the vector space of framed, embedded trivalent graphs in
$\RR^3$, modulo local skein relations that let us reduce unknots,
monogons, bigons, and triangles, and allow us to change framings along
edges and at vertices:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:simple-rels-spec}
  \begin{aligned}
    \unknot\; &= d&\quad
    \loopvertex\;&=0\\[5pt]
      \ngon{2}\;&= b\;\onestrandid&
        \ngon[-90]{3}\; &= t\;\nvertex[-90]{3}\\[5pt]
      \twist\; &= v^{12}\;\onestrandid&
        \twistvertex\; &= -v^{6}\;\nvertex[-90]{3}
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
  d &= -\frac{\{2\}[\lambda+5][\lambda-6]}{[\lambda][\lambda-1]}\\
  b &= \frac{\{\lambda+2\}\{\lambda-3\}[3]}{[1]}\\
  t &= \{1\}\bigl(\{1\}w^2/v + (v^4 - v^2 - 1 - v^{-2} + v^{-4}) +
      \{1\}v/w^2\bigr).
\end{align*}
To these skein relations, we add the \emph{quantum IHX relation}
\begin{equation}
v^{-3} \;
\drawcrossX
\;+ v \;
\drawI
\; -v^{-1} \;
 \drawH
\;
 - \frac{[\lambda][\lambda-1]}{[1]}
\left[\; \braidcross \;
 + v^{4}\;
\twostrandid
\; + v^{-4} \;
 \cupcap \;
 \right] = 0.\label{eq:quant-except-spec}
\end{equation}

We conjecture that the skein relations above suffice to evaluate
uniquely every framed knotted trivalent graph. In fact we split the
conjecture up into different parts.

\DPTtodo{Introduced some placeholder terminology here so I could state
  the conjectures more precisely. Feel free to change it.}
Let $R$ be the ring $\QQ[v,w,v - v^{-1},w - w^{-1}, w/v - v/w]$, that
is, the minimal ring for which all of the denominators in the skein
relations are defined. Let $\Skq{n,m}$ be the \emph{skein algebra vector space}
of framed, embedded trivalent $(n,m)$ tangles modulo the
local skein relations in \eqref{eq:simple-rels-spec}
and~\eqref{eq:quant-except-spec}. The different vector spaces
$\Skq{n,m}$ combine into a category $\Skqcat$ where the objects are
integers and the morphisms from $n$ to $m$ are elements of $\Skq{n,m}$.

\begin{conjecture}[Quantum consistency]
  \label{conj:quant-consist}
  There is a category $\mathsf{QExcept}$ where the objects are
  integers and morphisms are finite-dimensional, free $R$-modules, and
  a functor $\eval$ from $\Skqcat$ to $M_n$, that is the identity on
  objects and surjective on morphisms after extending scalars to
  $\QQ(v,w)$. Furthermore, $\mathsf{QExcept}(n,m)$ has dimension
  $1,\allowbreak0,\allowbreak1,\allowbreak1,\allowbreak5,\allowbreak16,\allowbreak80$
  for $n+m=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$, respectively, and $\eval$ takes a single
  strand and a trivalent vertex to generators of the respective
  morphism spaces.
\end{conjecture}

\DPTtodo{Is this too weak? To derive square reduction, we do assume
  something more about the denominators, so we probably do need to
  extend scalars at least a little. Would be nice to have a version of
  sufficiency that doesn't assume consistency}
\begin{conjecture}[Quantum sufficiency]
  \label{conj:quant-suffic}
  After extending scalars to $\QQ(v,w)$, the functor $\eval$
  conjectured above is injective on each morphism space. In
  particular, these relations suffice to evaluate any closed framed
  trivalent graph to a rational function in $v$ and~$w$.
\end{conjecture}

  The relations above are quite general. With some mild assumptions on
  the base ring, any skein theory where the $n$-box space has
  dimension at most $1,0,1,1,5$ for $n=0,1,2,3,4$ satisfies a version
  of relation~\eqref{eq:quant-except-spec}. See
  Theorem~\ref{thm:quant-except} in Section~\ref{sec:relation} for a
  precise statement.

\section{The classical exceptional series}
\label{sec:classical-except}

(Introduce Jacobi skein from Lie algebras.)

For any Lie algebra, the skein theory satisfies the \emph{Jacobi} (or \emph{IHX})
relation:
\begin{equation}
\drawI\; - \;\drawH\; + \;\drawcrossX\; = 0.
\label{eq:IHX}
\end{equation}
We will scale the value of a vertex so that a bubble has the
value~$6$, which implies the value of a trivalent bubble.
\begin{align}
\ngon{2}\; &= 6\;\onestrandid &
  \ngon{3}\; &= 3\;\nvertex{3}
  \label{eq:classical-bigon-trigon}
\end{align}

In addition, Vogel observed that all the exceptional Lie algebras
satisfy another relation, the \emph{classical exceptional relation},
which can be put in the form
\DPTtodo{Need to rename $w$, as we reuse it}
\begin{equation}
\ngon[45]{4}\; = \;\drawI\; + \;\drawH\;
 + w \left[ \;\twostrandid\; + \;\cupcap\; + \;\symcross\; \right]
\label{eq:classical-except}
\end{equation}
for varying values of~$w$.

\begin{theorem}[Vogel]
  For the following Lie groups, the skein theory of the Lie bracket in
  the adjoint representation
  satisfies the classical exceptional relation with the given values
  of $\mu$ and~$w$.
  \[
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    Group         & $\mu$ & $w$\\
    \midrule
    Trivial             & $5$ & $15$ \\
    $O(1 \mid 2)$       & $4$ & $10$ \\
    $\PSL(2)$           & $3$ & $6$ \\
    $\PSL(3)\rtimes\ZZ/2$& $2$ & $3$ \\
    $G_2$              & $3/2$ & $15/8$ \\
    $PO(8)\rtimes\ZZ/3$  & $1$ & $1$\\
    $F_4$               & $2/3$ & $5/9$\\
    $E_6\rtimes\ZZ/2$   & $1/2$ & $3/8$\\
    $E_7$               & $1/3$ & $2/9$ \\
    $E_8$               & $1/5$ & $3/25$ \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \]
\end{theorem}
In each case, the relevant group has the minimal representation
theory: representations in the root lattice (i.e., appearing in
decompositions of the adjoint representation), and invariant under
outer automorphisms (or symmetries of the Dynkin diagram).

\begin{remark}
  Almost every paper on the exceptional series introduces at least one new
  parameter for the series. We hold with this tradition by introducing the
  parameter~$w$ above. For reference, here is a list of the various
  parameters that have been used, along with how they are related to
  the parameter $\mu$ and who introduced them. It is often natural to
  parameterize the exceptional series with a parameter that is
  ambiguous, with two values for each group; if this applies, the
  involution relating the two values is also listed.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $a_D = \mu/6$; involution $a_D \leftrightarrow -a_D-1/6$ \cite{MR1378507}.
  \item $\lambda = -\mu$; involution $\lambda \leftrightarrow 1-\lambda$ \cite{MR1378507}.
  \item $\mu$ as in the table above; involution $\mu \leftrightarrow -1-\mu$ \cite{MR1411045}.
  \item $\nu = 1/\mu$; involution $\nu \leftrightarrow -\nu/(\nu+1)$
    \cite{MR1952563}.
  \item The dual Coxeter number $h^\vee = 6/\mu$
    \cite{MR1952563}.
  \item The number $w$ in Equation~\eqref{eq:classical-except}, with
    $w=\mu(1+\mu)/2$. This appears to be the first time it has been
    published, but it appeared in earlier preprint
    versions of Vogel's paper \cite{MR2769234}.
  \item\label{item:eigenvalues} The two non-trivial eigenvalues $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the ladder
    operator $\psi_L$ on $\Sym^2\fg$, defined by
    \[
    \psi_L\left(\;\idtangle\;\right) = \;\ladder\;.
    \]
    With vertices normalized by
    Equation~\eqref{eq:classical-bigon-trigon}, we have $\alpha = -\mu$ and
    $\beta = 1+\mu$ \cite{MR2769234}.
    The involution switches $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The usual quadratic
    Casimir is $12 - 2\psi_L$.
  \item The dimension of the Lie algebra $d = \dim \mathfrak{g} =
    -2\frac{(\mu-5)(\mu+6)}{\mu(\mu+1)}$.
  \item The dimension of an algebra related to triality, $a_{LM} =
    2(1-\mu)/\mu$ \cite{MR1933384}.
  \item $m = 6(1+\mu)/\mu$; involution $m/6 \leftrightarrow 6/m$
    \cite[Chapter 17]{MR2418111}.
  \end{enumerate}
  The essential issue is that with only a finite number of points to
  work with, there is no natural accumulation point to put at infinity
  and base the family around.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Vogel took item \ref{item:eigenvalues} on the list above as his
  starting point. It is easy to deduce
  Equation~\eqref{eq:classical-except} (with $w = -\alpha\beta/2$)
  from the condition on eigenvalues of $\psi_L$.
\end{remark}

Introduce skein theory over $\QQ(w)$ (or $\QQ[w]$?). Conjecture that
it is complete (everything is equivalent to a polynomial) and
consistent (no polynomials are consequences).

\DPTtodo{Figure out the Conjecture in \cite[Section
  7.5]{MR2769234}. Does it relate?}

\DPTtodo{Mention Cvitanovic \cite{MR2418111} somewhere. He also
  noticed the key relation, and did it earlier.}

\section{The quantum exceptional relation}
\label{sec:relation}

The main equation we are interested in is the \emph{quantum
  exceptional relation}:
\begin{equation}
v^{-3} \;
\drawcrossX
\;+ v \;
\drawI
\; -v^{-1} \;
 \drawH
\;
 + \alpha
\left[\; \braidcross \;
 + v^{4}\;
\twostrandid
\; + v^{-4} \;
 \cupcap \;
 \right] = 0.\label{eq:quant-except}
\end{equation}
In fact, this relation turns out to be quite universal.

For the remainder of this section, suppose that we are working in a
skein theory on embedded, framed trivalent graphs.

\begin{proposition}
  If the dimension of the $n$-box space for $n=0,1,2,3$ is $1,0,1,1$,
  respectively, then we have the relations
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:simple-rels}
  \begin{aligned}
    \unknot\; &= d&\qquad
      \twist\; &= s^2\;\onestrandid&\qquad
        \twistvertex\; &= -s\;\nvertex[-90]{3}\\[5pt]
    \loopvertex\;&=0&
      \ngon{2}\;&= b\;\onestrandid&
        \ngon[-90]{3}\; &= t\;\nvertex[-90]{3}
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  for some parameters $d, b, t, s$ in the base ring.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\NStodo{Add claim: trivalent vertex is rotationally symmetric}
  Most of these are immediate from the assumption. The one fact that
  is not immediate is the relation between the coefficients of
  twisting a vertex ($-s$ above) and changing framing ($s^2$
  above). Twisting a vertex twice can be turned into three framing
  changes, one on each of the adjacent strands.
\DPTtodo{This is standard, but needs pictures or a reference}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:quant-except}
  Suppose that $Q$ is a skein theory over a field on embedded, framed
  trivalent
  graphs so that the dimension of the $n$-box space for $n=0,1,2,3,4$
  is at most $1,0,1,1,5$, respectively. Suppose that the scalar $s$
  above has three distinct cube roots and at least one sixth root.
  Then either $Q$ vanishes on all trivalent
  graphs or it satisfies the quantum exceptional relation
  \eqref{eq:quant-except} for some choice of~$v$ with $v^6 = s$.
\end{theorem}

In fact, the conditions we need for the conclusion of
Theorem~\ref{thm:quant-except} are somewhat weaker than stated. In
particular, we
don't need to know the exact dimensions of the $n$-box spaces, just
that certain diagrams
are linearly dependent. We do not spell out the details here.

\begin{proof}
  Let $v$ be a sixth root of $s$ (arbitrary for the moment).
  By assumption, the space spanned by the six diagrams
  \[
  \twostrandid\;,\qquad\cupcap\;,\qquad\braidcross\;,
    \qquad\drawI\;,\qquad\drawH\;,\qquad\drawcrossX\;
  \]
  is at most $5$-dimensional.  These six diagrams should be thought
  of as having the symmetries of a tetrahedron (up to framing
  change). More precisely, consider the operation~$R$ that cyclically
  rotates three of the input strands.
  \[
  R\left(\,\,\idtangle\,\,\right) = \Rcycle.
  \]
  The operation~$R$ permutes the six diagrams above up to powers of $\pm
  v^k$:
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[inner sep=5pt] (A) at (150:1.4cm) {\twostrandid};
      \node[inner sep=5pt] (B) at (30:1.4cm) {\cupcap};
      \node[inner sep=5pt] (C) at (-90:1.4cm) {\braidcross};
      \draw[|->,bend left=15] (A) to node[above,cdlabel] {v^{-12}} (B);
      \draw[|->,bend left=15] (B) to (C);
      \draw[|->,bend left=15] (C) to (A);
    \end{tikzpicture}&&
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[inner sep=5pt] (D) at (150:1.4cm) {\drawI};
      \node[inner sep=5pt] (E) at (30:1.4cm) {\drawH};
      \node[inner sep=5pt] (F) at (-90:1.4cm) {\drawcrossX};
      \draw[|->,bend left=15] (D) to node[above,cdlabel] {-v^{-6}} (E);
      \draw[|->,bend left=15] (E) to node[below right,cdlabel] {\!\!-v^{-6}} (F);
      \draw[|->,bend left=15] (F) to (D);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{align*}
  The notation means, for instance, that
  \[
  R\left(\,\,\twostrandid\,\,\right) = v^{-12}\,\,\cupcap\,\,.
  \]
  Notice that $R^3$ acts by multiplication by $v^{-12}$. (Indeed,
  $R^3$ does not permute the strands, and is equivalent by
  Reidemeister moves to changing the
  framing on the upper-right strand by~$-1$.)

  In particular, the possible
  eigenvalues for $R$ are $v^{-4}$, $\omega_3 v^{-4}$, and
  $\omega_3^{-1} v^{-4}$, where $\omega_3$ is a primitive cube root of
  unity (which exists by assumption on the base ring). At least one of
  the three eigenspaces is at
  most one-dimensional. By possibly changing the choice of $v$ as a
  root of $-v^6$, we can assume that the eigenspace for $v^{-4}$ is at
  most one-dimensional. This then implies that there is a relation of
  the form
  \begin{equation*}
\beta \left[v^{-3} \;
\drawcrossX
\;+ v \;
\drawI
\; -v^{-1} \;
 \drawH
\;\right]
 + \alpha
\left[\; \braidcross \;
 + v^{4}\;
\twostrandid
\; + v^{-4} \;
 \cupcap \;\right]=0.
  \end{equation*}

  If $\beta \ne 0$, we are done. If $\beta = 0$, the relation reduces
  to the Kauffman bracket relation for the Jones polynomial:
\[
\braidcross \;
 + v^{4}\;
\twostrandid
\; + v^{-4} \;
 \cupcap\;=0.
\]
Closing this relation off with a trivalent vertex on the bottom yields
\begin{align*}
  \twistvertex + v^{-4}\; \nvertex[-90]{3} &= 0,
\end{align*}
so $-v^6 + v^{-4} = 0$, or $v^{10}=1$,
assuming that a trivalent vertex is not~$0$.
\NStodo{Explain that you get the golden category, and still have
  quantum exceptional relation in a degenerate way}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  If a skein theory satisfies the quantum exceptional
  relation~\eqref{eq:quant-except} and the reduction
  relations~\eqref{eq:simple-rels} with $v^{40} \ne 1$, then the
  parameters satisfy
  \begin{align}
    s &= v^6\label{eq:s-v-rel}\\
    b &= -\frac{\alpha(d + v^8 + v^{-8})}{v^5 - v^{-5}}\label{eq:b-rel}\\
%    b(v^5 - v^{-5}) + \alpha d + \alpha (v^8 + v^{-8}) &= 0\label{eq:b-rel}\\
    t &= \frac{b - \alpha(v^5 - v^{-5})}{v^2 + v^{-2}}\label{eq:b-t-rel}.
%    b - t(v^2 + v^{-2}) - \alpha (v^5 - v^{-5}) &= 0.\label{eq:b-t-rel}
  \end{align}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Equation~\eqref{eq:s-v-rel} is part of
  Theorem~\ref{thm:quant-except}. Equation~\eqref{eq:b-rel} follows
  from closing off Equation~\eqref{eq:quant-except} with a cap, and
  then solving for~$b$. Equation~\eqref{eq:b-t-rel} follows from
  closing off Equation~\eqref{eq:quant-except} by attaching two ends
  to a trivalent vertex, and then solving for~$t$.

  The condition that $v^{40} \ne 1$ guarantees that we do not divide
  by~$0$.
\end{proof}

Here are some things remaining for Dylan (or maybe Noah) to write
up/think about:
\begin{itemize}
\item Deriving the square-reduction relation using the quantum exceptional
\item Deriving the crossing change relation from the quantum
  exceptional relation, or maybe from another dimensionality (or
  maybe eigenvalue) argument
\item The F4--E6 family in this context
\item Showing there is an eigenvalue for the twist with eigenvalue
  $-1$, and finding the eigenvector
\item Naturally introducing a new parameter, $w$, an eigenvalue of
  rotation, and using it here to get nice formulas. Use ability to
  renormalize vertices.
\item Do a write-up that the classical existence conjecture implies
  the quantum existence conjecture, using the Kontsevich integral.
\end{itemize}

Here are some things Scott is hoping to work on soon:
\begin{itemize}
\item write a link evaluator using the clasp switch relation (in progress)
\item compute the action of the 3-strand braid group on diagrams with 4
boundary points
\begin{itemize}
\item find the eigenvalues of the generators and the scalar by which the full twist
acts; compare against Tuba-Wenzl \cite{MR1815266}.
\end{itemize}
\item try to compute the 3-strand braid group action on a basis for the 3-boxes
\begin{itemize}
\item perhaps even try to compute the structure coefficients for a basis for
the 3-boxes?
\end{itemize}
\item find the value of dodecahedron
\begin{itemize}
\item by computing the determinant of inner
products of 80 elements, including the difference of the two threepents, to
obtain a linear identity in the polyhedron
\item but linear algebra in
rational functions in 2 variables is very slow
\item perhaps finding the value at particular points and interpolating is worth
a try?
\item perhaps linear algebra with rational functions in \emph{one} variable,
then interpolating for the second, is also worth a try!
\end{itemize}
\item write a human readable summary of the computer calculation that braided +
$1,0,1,1,5,\leq16$ implies a planar pentasquare reduction formula
\item derive the planar pentasquare reduction formula directly from
  quantum IHX

  See the note \nolinkurl{2013-07-27-reducing-5-gon.pdf}.
\begin{quote}
``From your formula to get a planar pentasquare reduction, first note the second term can be rewritten using Jacobi as a difference of two planar diagrams.  Then we need to look at the third term, which is harder (there has to be one hard term because we haven't used Vogel's relation yet).  Use Vogel's relation to replace the square with a crossing and planar stuff.  This gives five terms,  three of which are easily rewritten to be planar.  Of the remaining two, one of them you can pull a Y through a crossing and then use Vogel to rewrite the crossing as planar stuff, and the other you can use Vogel directly on the crossing to get planar terms including a pentasquare.''
