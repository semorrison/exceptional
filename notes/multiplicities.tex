\title{Multiplicities in the quantum exceptional series}

For the classical exceptional series, Deligne \cite{MR1378507} gives
decomposition formulas for up to the third tensor power of the adjoint
representation. He also gives information about plethysm (which
representation of the symmetric group things appear in). Stripping
the plethysm information out, we have

\begin{align*}
  X_1^{\otimes 0} &\simeq 1\\
  X_1^{\otimes 1} &\simeq X_1\\
  X_1^{\otimes 2} &\simeq 1 \oplus X_1 \oplus X_2 \oplus Y_2^{(*)}\\
  X_1^{\otimes 3} &\simeq 1 \oplus 5X_1 \oplus 4X_2 \oplus 3Y_2^{(*)} \oplus X_3
                    \oplus Y_3^{(*)} \oplus 3A \oplus 2C^{(*)}.
\end{align*}
The notation $Y_2^{(*)}$, for instance, means $Y_2 \oplus
Y_2^*$. Recall that $X_1 = \fg$.

In an exceptional quantum group, we expect $X_1^{\otimes n}$ to have
commuting representations of $U_q(\fg)$ and of $B_n$. Of course
representations of $B_n$ are much more complicated than
representations of $S_n$, so the simple plethysm-type formulas aren't
going to make a lot of sense. The four different copies of (for instance)
$X_2$ inside of $X_1^{\otimes 3}$, which appear in three different
representations of $S_3$ in the plethysm formulas, presumably come
from a single irreducible representation of $B_3$ which happens to
become reducible at $q=1$.

In our diagrammatic calculus, we have no direct access to the
representation $X_1^{\otimes 3}$, since every diagram that we write
down is by definition invariant. Instead, we can compute the 6-box
space, which is $\End(X_1^{\otimes 3})$ and comes with a left and
right action by $B_3$. All the multiplicities end up getting squared
when we do that. Note that
\[
80 = 1 + 5^2 + 4^2 + 2\cdot 3^2 + 1 + 2\cdot 1 + 3^2 + 2\cdot 2^2.
\]

To sort out which representation is which, we look at the center of
the braid group, the full-twist operator $\Tw_n$. In general, Braid
group representations break up as a direct sum of representations with
different eigenvalues of this full twist. It is also related to the
quadratic Casimir. To get that relation more precise, it's a little
better to look at a related operator, the framing change operator
$\Fr$, which does a Reidemeister 1 move to the entire bundle of
strands. This is the same as doing a full twist and adding a kink
(Reidemeister 1) to each strand individually. As such, we have
\[
\Fr = v^{-12n} \Tw,
\]
since the framing change on each strand contributes a factor of
$v^{-12}$.

For $n=2$, we also have the half-twist operator $\HTw_2$, which does
only a half-twist. (This makes sense in general, but is only central
for $n=2$.)

The data for all representations up to the third tensor power is shown
in Table~\ref{tab:e-vals}. The ``Casimir'' column comes directly from
Deligne (using $a = -\lambda/6$ and $a^* = (-1+\lambda)/6$). For the
representations appearing in $\fg^{\otimes 2}$, the eigenvalue for the
half-twist was computed directly. There is an evident relation between
the the Casimir eigenvalue and the framing change eigenvalue, which
should follow by considering the Kontsevich integral. The factor of
$-12$ presumably comes from the choice of how to normalize a
bubble. On the remaining lines, the same pattern relating the Casimir
to the framing change was extended.
