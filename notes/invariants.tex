\section{Link invariants}
\subsection{Matrices}
Recall that we have candidate bases for $\V_n = \operatorname{Hom}(1 \to V^{\otimes n})$, for $n$ at most 6.
In this section, we obtain matrices for the operators braiding and rotation operators on $\V_n$.
\nn{diagrams defining these as the rotation and the braiding}.

We have a pairing $\langle , \rangle: \V_n \otimes \V \to \V_0$ defined by \nn{diagram}, and for many 
(conjecturally all) diagrams in $\V_0$ we can use the relations to evaluate to a rational function 
in $v$ and $w$. Of course, our basis is far from orthonormal with respect to this pairing!
We find, however, that up to $n=6$, we can evaluate all matrix entries of
$M = \left(\langle e_i, e_j \rangle\right)_{i,j}$,
but rather unfortunately inverting this matrix is computationally infeasible \nn{for which n?}.
(Recall that arithmetic over $\mathcal{Q}(v,w)$ is inefficient.)

Now, given an operator $T: \V_n \to \V_n$, the associated matrix with respect to our chosen basis is
$[T] = AM^{-1}$, where $A = \left(\langle T e_i, e_j \rangle\right)_{i,j}$. Again, we find that for
$T$ either the braiding or the rotation, we can evaluate all of the matrix entries of the $A$ 
as rational functions. Even though directly inverting $M$ is infeasible, we find that we can
calculate the product $A M^{-1}$ in each case.
(Nevertheless this remains a difficult calculation. \nn{some explanation of what we do, with the CRT})

\nn{Explicit matrices are available with the {\tt arXiv} sources of this article.}

\subsection{Limited planar operations}
Thinking of the vector space $\V_n$ as forming a planar algebra, 
at this point we have limited access to the full set of operations indexed. We can compute
$cap : \V_n \to \V_{n-2}$, 
$cup : \V_n \to V_{n+2}$, 
$\rho: \V_n \to \V_n$, 
$m_{4,4,2} : \V_4 \otimes \V_4 \to \V_4$,
$m_{6,4,2} : \V_6 \otimes \V_4 \to \V_6$, 
and finally $m_{4,4,1} : \V_4 \otimes \V_4 \to V_6$.

\nn{explain how we actually compute these maps, from above!}


\subsection{6-box presentations of links}
Typically, we may choose to think about a diagrammatically defined tangle invariant as a 
morphism of planar algebras $\operatorname{Tangle} \to \mathcal{Q}$ for some planar algebra 
$\mathcal{Q}$,
sending the crossing to a suitable element of $\mathcal{Q}_4$. In our case only know a 
limited set of operations in the target planar algebra
